            The Highlands really is the Scotland of your imagination. Think big skies, mind-blowing landscapes, superb food and hospitable people - and you've got the Scottish Highlands. There's a natural playground which begs to be explored, while the region's turbulent history has left behind some of the most beautiful and romantic castles in the world.

        <p id="para">
            A Highlands holiday will see you get lost - not literally - in the majestic mountains and mysterious lochs, pass through Britain's largest National Park, witness dolphins frolicking off the Moray Coast, marvel at the sensational seascape of the North Highlands, walk in the shadow of Britain's highest peak, Ben Nevis, or explore the stunning islands and stretches of coastline.

            The half kilometer stretch of golden sand attracts many watersports enthusiasts throughout the year with the months of August to October being the peak time for surfers. The rugged shoreline offers excellent opportunities for rock pooling and climbing and the surrounding area is home to many species of coastal birds including oystercatchers, rock doves and the famous puffin! The extremely rare primula scotica, the Scottish primrose, can also be found here.
